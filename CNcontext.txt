Origin of CraftNepal:
- CraftNepal has a unique origin story that began with a small group of friends who wanted to play games together back in 2014 - 2015.
As the Minecraft hype grew, they decided to create a vanilla survival server called myktmcraft, owned by Cnobi and his friends. The server quickly gained popularity, and players from all over joined to make great memories together. However, as time passed, the hype waned, and the server became less active. In 2019, when Minecraft became popular again, players started to flood in, but Cnobi was too busy to moderate the server. Meanwhile, a new Minecraft community in Nepal had formed: NepaliCrafters, owned by Subu and Code. Subu, who was a moderator in myktm, and the owner of NepaliCrafters and myktmcraft decided to merge their servers and create a bigger server located in Nepal, which they named CraftNepal.
Since then, CraftNepal has continued to grow and evolve, and in 2021, they introduced Seasons of Minecraft Survival. This meant the world resets every year, allowing Minecraft players to start a new adventure at every season. Today, in 2023, CraftNepal is still serving Minecraft players, and the community continues to thrive. From its humble beginnings as a group of friends playing games together, to a thriving Minecraft community in Nepal, CraftNepal's journey is a testament to the power of friendship, creativity, and the joy of gaming.

Player guide for craftnepal:
    - if a player asks about their playtime or their statistics, redirect them to our website craftnepal.net or help using ingame commands that you know
   Here are all the frequently asked questions by the players:

    - How do I join your Minecraft server?
        Verification is required to join our server for which, you must have a Discord account already set up. You must follow Discord T&C and our Rules (listed 
        above & in our Discord Server) in order to play in our server.

        Phase 1 - Connecting your Minecraft Account to Discord:

        Access our Minecraft server using the IP: play.craftnepal.net
        A screen will prompt you to link your account to Discord by entering a 4-digit code.
        Send the 4-digit code directly to our CraftNepal Bot, in our Discord server, to complete the linking process.
        Reconnect to the server after completing the linking process.
        Phase 2 - First-time Player Account Registration:

        For first-time players, registration of your account is required.
        Once you are in-game, type this command in chat: /register followed by your password, twice.
        Example: /register rambahadur123 rambahadur123
        Your account will then be created and stored in the server's database. Remember to securely store your password.
        Phase 3 - Logging in to our Server the next time you log in:

        When you connect to the server in subsequent sessions, you will need to log in.
        Once you are in-game, type this command in chat: /login password Example: /login rambahadur123 

    - What is CraftNepal IP address?
        play.craftnepal.net

    - I am about to die, can mod TP me to safety?
        No.

    - How can I become a Mod?
        We currently are not accepting Mod applications.

    -What is jail?
        Jail serves as a designated area within our server where individuals who violate the rules are sent to reflect upon their actions.
        Players who disregard the warnings from our moderators regarding rule violations will be subjected to imprisonment.
        In cases of severe rule infractions, individuals may face a ban from participating in our server.

        To ensure compliance with our rules, we kindly request that you familiarize yourself with our rules guide provided both above and on our Discord server.

    - Is it cheating if I use an auto clicker?
        Yes, using an auto clicker would be deemed as cheating in our server since it presents the player as actively participating when they are actually not. Employing an auto clicker disrupts the fairness of rankings and leaderboards, thereby creating an unfair advantage over other players.

    - Can I use anti-AFK mechanisms in this server?
        No, anti-AFK mechanisms can result in unfair advantages by allowing players to increase playtime without active gameplay, undermining competition and jeopardizing the rank system. Additionally, these mechanisms disrupt social dynamics within the game and any player found using anti-AFK mechanisms will be kicked from the server.

    - Can I AFK my farms?
        Yes, you can go AFK as long as you refrain from engaging in any activities like using auto-clickers or anti-AFK mechanisms. In case you need to indicate that you are away from the keyboard, you can utilize the "/afk" command. There will be no repercussions such as being kicked or banned under these circumstances.

    - Can I use Freecam?
        Players can use the Freecam feature for legitimate purposes only.
        HOWEVER, it is crucial to understand that any misuse of Freecam with the intent to cheat or gain unfair advantages WILL result in punishment.
        The primary purpose of Freecam is to enhance exploration or cinematic experiences for players, rather than exploit or manipulate gameplay mechanics unfairly.
        We have implemented strict rules to deter and penalize any improper use of Freecam or other features that undermine the fairness and integrity of the Minecraft gameplay within our server.

    - What is considered cheat in this server?
        In our CraftNepal Minecraft server, we have strict rules regarding cheats and unfair gameplay practices. These include:

        The use of hacked clients or modifications that provide unfair advantages, such as x-ray vision, fly hacks, or speed hacks.
        Exploiting glitches or bugs in the game to gain an unfair advantage, such as item duplication or accessing restricted areas.
        Unauthorized trading or sharing of in-game items or accounts.
        Using third-party programs or tools that automate gameplay or give unfair advantages, such as auto-clickers or macros.
        Collaborating with other players to engage in unfair practices or manipulate game mechanics for an unfair advantage.
        Engaging in griefing, which involves intentionally stealing, destroying or vandalizing other players' creations or the server's environment.

    - Why can't I make a shop?
        Before opening your shop, please make sure that you have unlocked the "Vyapari" Rank in the game and have carefully followed the instructions provided in the Market Guide.

Market place in craftnepal:
    In our community, we use a virtual currency called '$' which is used for buying and selling items in the game. One diamond on our server is worth $200, making it a valuable asset for players to obtain. It's worth noting that when players sell diamonds or other items in the Market, they are taxed at a rate of 5%. This helps to maintain a healthy economy on our server and prevent excessive inflation. You are only able to create a shop once you have ranked up to Vyapari rank.
    - Where can I build my shop:
        Go to the designated Market place and claim a part of the land where you want to build your shop using a wooden shovel.
        You must build a structure for your shop before selling any items.
        You can signpost your shop as 'under construction' if you are not ready to sell yet.
        By creating a shop or using a shop in the Market, you are agreeing to follow and abide by the Market Rules.
    - How do I sell items in my own shop in the Market?
        Place a chest in your shop's build.
        Left-click this chest with the item on your right hand that you want to sell.
        A message in chat pops up instructing you to enter the price you want to set for that item.
        Once you have input the amount you want to sell the item for, the chest will automatically have a sign saying 'Selling'.
        At this point, you will need to add the items into the chest you've just created so other players can buy from it.
        Note: every price change has a fee so think carefully before setting your prices.
    - How do I buy items from a shop in the Market?
        Look for the chest with the item you want to buy.
        Once you have found what you are looking for, make sure the sign on the chest says 'Selling'.
        Left-click the chest shop.
        Shop information pops up in chat with instructions for you to enter the number of items you want to buy in the chat.
        Once you have entered the number of items you want to buy, the shop will automatically take money from your balance and the item will be in your inventory.
        Note: Always make sure you have enough money in your balance to purchase the item and you have enough space in your inventory.
    - How do I delete my shop from the Market?
        Go to the chest and right-click on the sign.
        In the chat, you will see 'RemoveShop'. Click on it.
        This will remove the shop from the Market, and it will be only a plain old chest.
        Note: There is no fee for this change.
    - How do I change the price of an item in my shop?
        Go to the chest and right-click on the sign of the item you want to change the price.
        In the chat, you will see 'Change' next to the price. Click on it.
        Type the new price in the chat.
        The new prices will take effect immediately, and players will be able to buy and sell items at the new rates.
        Note: every price change has a fee so think carefully before setting your prices.
    - How do I change from selling to buying or vice versa?
        Go to the chest and right-click on the sign of the item you want to change.
        Shop Control Panel will pop up in the chat.
        Click on the 'Change' next to the Shop Mode to change your shop into buying or selling mode.
        Note: There is no fee for this change.
    - How do I determine prices for my items to sell?
        To effectively price your items for selling, you can follow these steps:
        Use the "/worth" command to check the server's estimated price for the items you wish to sell. This will give you an idea of their market value.
        You cannot sell an item for a price lower than 10% of its "/worth" value. This restriction ensures a fair minimum price standard.
        However, you have the freedom to set the selling price as high as you desire. Consider factors such as rarity, demand, and competition when determining a 
        suitable price for your items.
        If you don't follow the minimum price limit, your shop will be removed. This rule is in place to make sure everyone plays fair and has an equal opportunity 
        to trade.

Details about Grief Prevention that you should know:
    - Land claims are easy to manage.
        Players create and manage their own land claims, so you don’t have to do it for them.
        New players get automatic claims around their first chests so they’re protected even if they don’t know how to create land claims yet.
        Players who ask for help in chat get an instant link to a demonstration video.
        Resizing claims and creating new claims is done with ONLY the mouse, no slash commands (slash commands are also available).
        When a player appears to be building something nice outside his claim, he’s warned and shown his claim boundaries.
        Claim boundaries are easy to see, and don’t require any client-side mod installation.
        Extremely easy-to-remember, single-parameter slash commands for giving other players permissions.
        Claim subdivision and granular permissions are available to organize towns and cities.

    - It’s IMPOSSIBLE to grief a land claim.
        No building or breaking.
        No stealing from ANY containers.
        No sleeping in beds.
        No button/lever usage.
        No adjusting redstone repeaters or other configurable blocks.
        No pushing blocks in with pistons.
        No pulling blocks out with pistons.
        No TNT damage (including cannons).
        No creeper damage.
        No explosive damage from other plugins, like Extra Hard Mode or Magic Spells.
        No enderman/silverfish block changes.
        All doors may be automatically locked (optional, see config file).
        No killing or luring animals away.
        No stealing water (e.g. buckets).
        No trampling crops by players, animals, or monsters.
        No building overtop, all claims reach to the max build height.
        No placing or breaking paintings / item frames / armor stands, etc.
        Fluids will not flow into a claim from outside.
        No placing blocks via TNT/Sand/Gravel cannon.

    - Pets and death loot are protected.
        Players can’t pick up what another player dropped on death without permission (configurable, of course)
        All types of pets can be protected everywhere, even outside of land claims (can be configured per-world)

    - Wilderness Protection and Rollback
        Fire doesn’t spread or destroy blocks.
        Creepers and other explosions don’t destroy blocks above sea level.
        TNT doesn’t destroy blocks above sea level.
        No planting trees on platforms in the sky (“tree grief”).

    - Land claims can’t be used as a griefing tool.
        It’s impossible to get a player “stuck” inside a land claim.
        Land claims beyond the first require a golden shovel.
        Minimum claim size prevents sprinkling small claims to annoy other players.
        Max claim allowance grows with time played on the server, and can’t be cheated by idling.
        A simple administrative slash command will instantly remove all of a griefer’s claims, no matter where they are.

    - It prevents pvp in calimed lands.
